# **Data Analysis of Movielens Dataset**

The GroupLens Research Project is a research group in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at the University of Minnesota. The data is widely used for collaborative filtering and other filtering solutions. However, we will be using this data to act as a means to demonstrate our skill in using Python to “play” with data.

**To Determine following data from the dataset:**

1.  need to import 3 files from the folder as data frames into your Jupyter notebook o u.data o u.item o u.user

2. Display univariate plots of the attributes: 'rating', 'age', 'release date', 'gender' and 'occupation', from their respective data frames

3. Visualize how popularity of Genres has changed over the years. From the graph one should be able to see for any given year, movies of which genre got released the most.

4. Display the top 25 movies by average rating, as a list/series/dataframe.

5. Verify the following statements : o Men watch more drama than women o Men watch more Romance than women o Women watch more Sci-Fi than men
